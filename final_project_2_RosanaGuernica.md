## Revisions from Part I Feedback
 
I changed my visualizations to more straightforward charts such as heatmaps, bar graphs, and a drop down menu. I also made certain to include axis labels and legends for each visualization. See some of the revised sketches below:

## Implementation 

For the introduction of this data story I wanted to encapsulate the timeliness of the topic. I found data on the number of black lives matter and police reform protets that have taken place this summer on the [Crownd Counting Consortium](https://sites.google.com/view/crowdcountingconsortium/home). I wanted to include this statistic - 6,600 protets across the U.S. from May - July 2020 - as a visualization. I played around with a few ideas, including a geographical map showing how these protest took place across the country (see below). After showing it to a few people the feedback I received indicated that it distracted from the real story - which is using data for reform, not the number of protets or their locations.  From this process, I learned that not EVERY statistic has to be represented in a visualization. Some, such as the one that I used, are helpful to provide context, but not meaningful enough to attract the audiences attention to its visualization.
