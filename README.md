# About me 
Hi - my name is Rosana. I'm a Public Policy and Management master's candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduate in August. After graduation I will be continuing my work at AH Datalytics - a consulting firm focused on bringing cutting edge analytics to public organizations. My primary focus is on harnessing data to help police departments in their reform efforts. 

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to create clean and thought-provoking visualizations that communicate their data's stories. 

Data can effect real and meaningful change in the world, and for the better. The caveat with data-driven change is that the people operationalizing data don't read data files the same ways computers to do. We need storytellers to act as an intermediary - to visualize problems, models, predictions, and solutions. I hope to develop the skills needed to begin telling those stories.
