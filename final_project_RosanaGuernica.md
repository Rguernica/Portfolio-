## The Data 

This project uses the Cincinnati Police Department's Call for Service dataset. The data is produced by the City's computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. CAD systems record police incident response activity, including all calls for service to emergency operatiors, 911, alarms, police radio and non-emergency calls. 

This dataset is updated daily and is publicly accessible. It can be acccessed on the [Cincinnati's Police Data Initiatve webpage](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safety/PDI-Police-Data-Initiative-Police-Calls-for-Servic/gexm-h6bt).
