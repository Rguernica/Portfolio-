# Data-Driven Decision-Making in Police Departments
## Final Project - Part I
                                                                                                        

## Introduction and Outline

With all the current discussion surrounding police reform, I wanted to introduce an aspect of policing that is often overlooked: data. Now, I'm not referring to predictive-policing or investigative analytics but rather data for police management, oversight, and reform. You're probably already familiar with the concept, and the importance, of data-driven decision making. One of the problems in police reform is the lack of data. Especially for organizational purposes. 

Fortunately, Call For Service (CFS) data is already gathered at most police departments across the country. These databases record all calls for service to emergency operatiors, 911, alarms, police radio and non-emergency calls. We can use CFS data as a rich source of information on police activity. This can be tedious since most CFS databses are large, raw, and messy. But it's for precisely those same reasons that we can use it to produce a variety of insights, such as how police officers spend their time, or whether their crime rates are being suppressed. Building effective dashboards that are automatically updated with new data entries can make this information accessible to the general public, supervisors, and city council members. 

I'll demonstrate some of these insights on shorthand, using an embedded dashboard built on Power BI. 

## The Data 

This project uses the Cincinnati Police Department's Call for Service dataset. The department's CFS data is captured by the City of Cincinnati's Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system. This system records all calls for service and their dispatch information. Officers who answer a call update the system to reflect on-scene findings. 

This dataset is updated daily and is publicly accessible. It can be acccessed on the [Cincinnati's Police Data Initiatve webpage](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safety/PDI-Police-Data-Initiative-Police-Calls-for-Servic/gexm-h6bt). In compliance with privacy laws, the dataset has been anonymized and redacted. 


I'll be using the dataset to analyze and visualize the following 

- The call 'category': Medical, Responsive (incidents not iniated by an officer, such as burglar alarms, distrubances, or assisting other agencies), Non-UCR Crime (incidents that criminal but do not fit the FBI's Uniform Crime Report), Proactive (incidents initiative by a police offcier, such as a follow-up investigation or routine patrol), Property Crime, Traffic, and Violent Crime;

- Time spent on calls and time spent on calls by category 

- Call category by disposition (whether the call resulted in an arrest, the towing of a vehicle, if there was no one at the scene when the officers arrived, if it was a false alarm, for example);

- The geographic distribution of call categories; 

- Call category by time of day, week, month, and year;

- Average time between intial call, dispatch, and arrival.
