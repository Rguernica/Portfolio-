# Final Project - Part I
                                                                                                        

## Introduction and Outline

For my final project I will be showing how data plays a crucial role in police management and reform. Specifically, I'll show what insights supervisors and city councils can gather from a police departments call for service data, and how decision makers may use these insights in police reform efforts. 

Story Arc: 

Mediums: This story will be displayed on shorthand. It will feature an embedded dashboard built on Power BI. 

## The Data 

This project uses the Cincinnati Police Department's Call for Service dataset. The data is produced by the City's computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system. CAD systems record police incident response activity, including all calls for service to emergency operatiors, 911, alarms, police radio and non-emergency calls. 

This dataset is updated daily and is publicly accessible. It can be acccessed on the [Cincinnati's Police Data Initiatve webpage](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safety/PDI-Police-Data-Initiative-Police-Calls-for-Servic/gexm-h6bt).
